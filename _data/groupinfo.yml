            Anne Gardner joined the Pugh lab in 2021 as Lab Manager. She is
            excited to be back at Cornell where she completed her
            undergraduate in Biology. She earned her PhD in Immunology at Duke
            University on immunoglobulin intracellular transport during B cell
            differentiation and did a postdoctoral fellowship at National
            Jewish Immunology focusing on MAP kinase signal transduction
            pathways.

            Josh received his BS in Biology with the Neuroscience option from Penn
            State, shortly thereafter joining the Pugh Lab in December of 2022.
            As a technician, he has been exploring the use of mammalian tissue as
            a substrate for ChIP-exo.

            Matthew received his bachelor's degree in Viticulture and Enology from
            Cornell University. He is interested in the yeast and bacteria that are
            responsible for producing beer and wine. Since the production of beer and
            wine is stressful to yeast, Matthew has been studying where transcription
            factors are bound to DNA in yeast as a response to different stress factors
            using ChIP-exo.

            Ruihao completed his Bachelor's degree in Life Sciences at Huazhong 
            University of Science and Technology in 2017. Following this, he 
            pursued his PhD in Quantitative and Systems Biology at the University 
            of California, Merced, graduating in 2023. Shortly after, he joined 
            Pugh's lab as a postdoctoral fellow. He is committed to constructing 
            mathematical models and developing computational tools to elucidate 
            the intricate networking between transcription factors and genes.
